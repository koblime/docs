The following API is subject to change. It is documented here so users may download content from Koblime in order to back it up.

## REST API

The Koblime API is organized around REST. The API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

There is no test API at this time so please be careful when making any destructive changes like using DELETE verbs.
