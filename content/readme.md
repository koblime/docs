Thank you for taking some time to try out Koblime. This guide is a work in progress. You can submit a pull request to this documentation if you come across any errors or which to add to it. Also, if there is something you would like covered, please post an [Issue](https://github.com/koblime/docs/issues).

## Public Beta

We are currently in public beta. While every effort is made to make the application stable, bugs happen. It is best if you back up your Kobo before installing Koblime.
